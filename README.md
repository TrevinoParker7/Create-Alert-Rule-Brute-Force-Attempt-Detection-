![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078932c1-3e7e-48cf-a0c1-1cd787336ce6)

---

## Scenario Context
As a security analyst for a large financial services organization relying heavily on Microsoft Azure services, I observed multiple failed login attempts, particularly targeting privileged accounts during off-hours. This raises concerns about a brute-force attack or a credential-stuffing campaign. 

My goal is to investigate, detect, and mitigate this potential threat in compliance with **NIST 800-61** guidelines.

---

## üîç **Objective: Create Sentinel Scheduled Query Rule**
Implement a **Sentinel Scheduled Query Rule** using KQL in Log Analytics to detect when the same remote IP address fails to log in to the same Azure VM 10+ times within a 5-hour period.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Platforms and Tools**
- **Microsoft Sentinel**
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**
- **Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)**

---

## **Incident Response Phases**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Preparation
1. **Policies and Procedures:**
   - Establish protocols for handling brute-force attempts, account lockouts, and account recovery.
   - Include predefined actions for notifications, account lockdowns, and reporting suspicious activity.

2. **Access Control and Logging:**
   - Enable logging of all login attempts across Azure AD.
   - Integrate with **Microsoft Defender for Identity** and **Azure Sentinel** for automated detection and alerts.

3. **Training:**
   - Train the security team to handle credential-based attacks, including brute force and credential stuffing.

4. **Communication Plan:**
   - Create an escalation plan for IT support and privileged account holders during incidents.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Detection & Analysis
#### Observations:
- **Three Azure VMs** were targeted by brute force attempts from **two public IPs**:
  
  | **Remote IP**       | **Failed Attempts** | **Target Machine**    |
  |---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
  | `194.180.48.18`     | 21                  | `windows-target-1`    |
  | `194.180.48.11`     | 20                  | `windows-target-1`    |
  | `113.56.218.168`    | 40                  | `windowsvm-mde-c`     |

- KQL Query to detect failed logins:  
  ```kql
  DeviceLogonEvents
  | where RemoteIP in ("194.180.48.18", "113.56.218.168")
  | where ActionType != "LogonFailed"
  ```

  **Result:** No successful logins from these IPs were detected.

#### Analysis Steps:
1. **Review Patterns:**
   - Investigated failed login thresholds in Azure AD logs.
   - Identified off-hours timing and suspicious IP geolocations.

2. **Document Findings:**
   - Retained logs detailing the frequency, origin, and targets of failed attempts.

3. **Prioritize:**
   - **High Priority:** Privileged accounts targeted during off-hours.
   - **Low Priority:** Isolated, user-specific failed attempts.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Containment
#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Device Isolation:**
   - Isolated affected devices using **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.

2. **Network Security Group (NSG) Update:**
   - Restricted RDP access to authorized IPs only.
   - Blocked all external IPs linked to failed login attempts.

3. **Anti-Malware Scans:**
   - Performed scans on affected devices for potential compromise.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Eradication & Recovery
1. **Password Reset:**
   - Reset passwords for targeted accounts.
   - Enforced strong password policies for privileged accounts.

2. **MFA Enforcement:**
   - Enabled multi-factor authentication for all high-value accounts.

3. **Geo-blocking:**
   - Blocked login attempts from high-risk geolocations.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Incident Activity
1. **Lessons Learned:**
   - Was detection quick and effective?
   - Were privileged accounts adequately protected?

2. **System Improvements:**
   - Adjusted login thresholds for quicker detection.
   - Expanded employee training on password security.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Recorded all findings, actions taken, and future recommendations.

---

## üö´ **Outcome**
- **Attack Status:** Brute force attempts **unsuccessful**.  
- **Recommendations:** Lockdown NSG rules for all VMs and enforce MFA on privileged accounts.

üéâ **Status:** Incident resolved. No further action required.
